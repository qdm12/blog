Let's face it. Global variables are mostly bad and you should not use them.

BUT they are cases where it's better to use them. This post will explore these.

## Sentinel errors

In Go, you don't *throw* and *catch* errors.

You wrap and return them, and check them with `errors.Is(err, errSomething)`.

You may wonder what `errSomething` is? It's a **sentinel error**.

The error check `errors.Is(err, errSomething)` will return `true` only if `errSomething` is the **same** error variable as `err` or as the one wrapped in `err`.

That means in we would get in this code example:

```go
errTest := errors.New("test error")

err := fmt.Errorf("some context: %w", errTest)

fmt.Println(errors.Is(err, errTest)) // true
fmt.Println(errors.Is(err, errors.New("test error"))) // false
fmt.Println(errors.Is(err, errors.New("some context: test error"))) // false
```

As you can see, you need the actual same variable for `errors.Is` to work.

And... that's why we need **sentinel errors defined as global variables**.

On top of this, unless you handle the error within a package (log it out or take some other action), you should **export** the sentinel errors. A more concrete example would be:

```go
package store

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
)

var ErrUserIDNotFound = errors.New("user id not found")

func (s *Store) GetUser(userID string) (user User, err error) {
    user, ok := s.idToUser[userID]
    if !ok {
        return user, fmt.Errorf("%w: %s", ErrUserIDNotFound, userID)
    }
    return user, nil
}
```

And a user of this package would use:

```go
package main

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    store := store.New()
    const userID = "123"
    user, err := store.GetUser(userID)
    if errors.Is(err, store.ErrUserIDNotFound) { // <- we need the error exported at global scope!
        fmt.Println("id not in here dawg")
        os.Exit(1)
    } else if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("error:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    fmt.Println("user found:", user)
}
```

Note `errors.Is(err, store.ErrUserIDNotFound)` which is the important code piece here, highlighting why sentinel errors have to be exported and defined at global scope.

## Regex

The standard library `regexp` package can compile regular expressions using two ways:

1. `regexp.Compile(str string) (r *regexp.Regexp, err error)`
2. `regexp.MustCompile(str string) *regexp.Regexp`

Now two additional facts to consider:

- Compiling a regular expression takes some time
- A compiled regular expression is immutable

Therefore, as soon as you have a **constant regular expression string**, you should have its compiled regular expression as a **global variable** (unexported by default). For example:

```go
package main

import (
  "regexp"
)


var regexAlphaNumeric = regexp.MustCompile(`^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`)

func isAlphaNumeric(s string) (ok bool) {
    return regexAlphaNumeric.MatchString(s)
}
```

This allows to compile the regex **only once**, and also to detect any regular expression issue at program start time (or by running a test importing this package).

**However**, do not define regular expressions with a variable string expression as global variables, and use `regexp.Compile` instead, checking its error.

## Variables set by the build pipeline

You can set global variable values from the `go build` command. For example:

`main.go`:

```go
package main

var version = "unknown"
```

using the build command:

```sh
go build -ldflags="-X 'main.version=test-1'" main.go
```

will set the global variable `version` to `"test-1"`.

Unfortunately, there is no way around using global variables in this case.

## Beware of these

### Caser

Since Go 1.18, `strings.Title` is now deprecated.
It was tempting to have the newer `*caser.Caser` at global scope:

```go
package main

import (
  "golang.org/x/text/cases"
  "golang.org/x/text/language"
)

var titleCaser = cases.Title(language.English)

func process(s string) string {
    return titleCaser.String(s)
}
```

To avoid re-creating a Title `cases.Caser` on every call to `process`.

However, `caser.Caser` is stateful and NOT thread safe. Therefore it gets messy quicky, even running parallel subtest will make it panic your code.

So don't have it as a global variable!

## High performance byte slices

You might think that having a global scope byte slice would yield higher performance? Benchmark, unless it's megabytes, it won't make a difference with a locally defined byte slice.

If you want a globally accessibly 'byte slice', have the byte slice data as a constant string and convert it where needed to a byte slice. In example:

```go
package main

import "bytes"

const globalConstant = "global constant"

func main() {
    _ = bytes.Count([]byte(globalConstant), []byte{1})
}
```

## Conclusion

Global variables are bad. But a necessary evil for sentinel errors
There are use cases for immutable variables (like regex) where it makes sense to use as well.
But otherwise, don't use them ðŸ˜‰
